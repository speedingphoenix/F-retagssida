          On the street and in the stadium, FIFA 21 has more ways to play than
          ever before. FIFA 21 rewards you for your creativity and control all
          over the pitch. Create more scoring opportunities with all-new dynamic
          attacking systems in the most intelligent FIFA gameplay to date. A new
          Agile Dribbling system gives you the means to unleash your creativity
          in 1-on-1 situations. Use fast footwork, more responsive close
          control, and new skill moves like the ball roll fake to explode past
          defenders. In FIFA 21, increased positional awareness elevates
          footballersâ€™ in-game intelligence to put them in the right place at
          the right time. See world-class forwards hold their runs in line with
          the last defender, creative playmakers find space to play through
          balls, and midfielders shut off passing lanes as players better live
          up to their real-world understanding of space and time on the pitch.

        <h2>3. Transformers: Battlegrounds</h2>
        <h4>Date of realse: 23 October, 2020</h4>

          Transformers: Battlegrounds is a video game by Coatsink, released
          October 23, 2020. It is the first new Transformers game released for a
          home console since Activision's previous game development license
          expired. Described as a "tactical warfare adventure" game,
          Battlegrounds is based on the Cyberverse franchise, featuring the
          character designs and voice actors from the accompanying animated
          series. Battlegrounds is set in an alternate version of the Cyberverse
          cartoon continuity; although it picks up where "Eruption" left off, it
          is otherwise largely irreconcilable with the events of that show's
          second season. A conversation between Arcee and Wheeljack suggests
          that this game takes place in one of the many alternate universes that
          the Cyberverse cartoon repeatedly alluded to over the course of its
          second and third seasons.

          Set within a fictionalised representation of a future, dystopian
          London, the game's story focuses on the hacker group DedSec as they
          seek to clear their names for a series of bombings that impacted the
          city, as well as liberating its citizens from its surveillance state
          by an oppressive private military company.

        <p>
          The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope is a survival horror video
          game played from a third-person perspective in which the player
          assumes control of five characters who are trapped in a ghost town.
          Throughout the game, the player needs to choose different dialogue
          options, which will influence the course of the narrative and the
          relationships between the protagonists. The game can be played
          multiple times, as there are multiple endings and multiple scenarios
          based on the decisions that the players make. Depending on the choices
          of the players, all characters may die by the end of the story. Action
          sequences mainly feature quick time events, most of which, if missed,
          can lead to dire consequences for the characters.
