          <h3>About the game:</h3>
          <p>
            On the street and in the stadium, FIFA 21 has more ways to play than
            ever before. FIFA 21 rewards you for your creativity and control all
            over the pitch. Create more scoring opportunities with all-new
            dynamic attacking systems in the most intelligent FIFA gameplay to
            date. A new Agile Dribbling system gives you the means to unleash
            your creativity in 1-on-1 situations. Use fast footwork, more
            responsive close control, and new skill moves like the ball roll
            fake to explode past defenders. In FIFA 21, increased positional
            awareness elevates footballersâ€™ in-game intelligence to put them in
            the right place at the right time. See world-class forwards hold
            their runs in line with the last defender, creative playmakers find
            space to play through balls, and midfielders shut off passing lanes
            as players better live up to their real-world understanding of space
            and time on the pitch.
