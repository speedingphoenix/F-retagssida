              League of Legends is often cited as the world's largest esport,
              with an international competitive scene. In League of Legends,
              players form a team of five and assume the role of a champion,
              characters with unique abilities, generally varying around a type
              of class, and battle against a team of player- or
              computer-controlled champions. In the main game mode, Summoner's
              Rift, the goal is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, a
              structure that lies at the heart of their base and is protected by
              defensive structures.

              Among Us takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players
              each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a
              predetermined number being Impostors. he goal of the Crewmates is
              to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks
              around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and
              kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks.
              Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a
              plurality vote, which any player may initiate at any time.
              Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are
              completed; Imposters win if there is an equal number of Impostors
              and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.
