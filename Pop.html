              This first-person shooter game is the 16th overall in the Call of
              Duty series. The game takes place in a realistic and modern
              setting. The campaign follows a CIA officer and British SAS forces
              as they team up with rebels from the fictional country of
              Urzikstan, combating together against Russian forces who have
              invaded the country. The game's Special Ops mode features
              cooperative play missions that follow up the campaign's story. The
              multiplayer mode supports cross-platform multiplayer and
              cross-platform progression for the first time in the series. It
              has been reworked for gameplay to be more tactical and introduces
              new features, such as a Realism mode that removes the HUD as well
              as a form of the Ground War mode that now supports 64 players.

              Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios.
              Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is
              the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies
              sold and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020. In
              Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D
              world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw
              materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or
              earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight
              computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete
              against other players in the same world. Game modes include a
              survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build
              the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players
              have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create
              new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

              In New Horizons, the player assumes the role of a customizable
              character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a
              package from Tom Nook, a tanuki character who has appeared in
              every entry in the Animal Crossing series. Taking place in
              real-time, the player can explore the island in a nonlinear
              fashion, gathering and crafting items, catching insects and fish,
              and developing the island into a community of anthropomorphic
              animals.
